# Deepfake Recognition & Face Analysis

Research project focused on developing robust systems for Deepfake detection, conducted at **Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM)**.

## 🚀 Overview
The project explores the generalization capabilities of computer vision models in distinguishing real faces from synthetic ones, specifically addressing the challenge of cross-database bias.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
* **Models**: Implementation based on **ResNet-50** architecture and feature extraction using **dlib**.
* **Intra-database Analysis**: Achieved a **0.98 AUC** on the UADFV dataset.
* **Generalization**: Critical study of performance drops in cross-database scenarios (e.g., testing on Celeb-DF).
